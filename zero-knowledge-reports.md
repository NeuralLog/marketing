# Zero-Knowledge Reports and Full Knowledge Conversion

NeuralLog's zero-knowledge reports provide a revolutionary way to gain insights from your logs without exposing sensitive data. This document explains how zero-knowledge reports work and how they can be selectively converted to full knowledge when needed.

## Understanding Zero-Knowledge Reports

### What are Zero-Knowledge Reports?

Zero-knowledge reports are AI-generated insights based on patterns in encrypted data:

1. **Pattern Summaries**: Identify common patterns without revealing specific values
2. **Anomaly Indicators**: Highlight unusual patterns without exposing details
3. **Trend Analysis**: Track changes over time without decrypting content
4. **Risk Assessments**: Evaluate potential issues while maintaining privacy

### How They Work

Zero-knowledge reports leverage NeuralLog's unique architecture:

1. **Token Analysis**: The system analyzes encrypted search tokens without seeing plaintext
2. **Pattern Detection**: Statistical analysis identifies significant patterns and correlations
3. **Frequency Analysis**: Unusual token frequencies can indicate anomalies
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Changes in patterns over time reveal trends

      "temporal_distribution": "consistent",
      "anomaly_score": 0.12,
      "related_patterns": ["pattern-003", "pattern-007"]
    },
    {
      "id": "pattern-002",
      "frequency": 0.05,

### Benefits of Zero-Knowledge Reports

1. **Privacy Preservation**: Gain insights without exposing sensitive data
2. **Compliance Friendly**: Maintain regulatory compliance while analyzing logs
3. **Reduced Exposure**: Minimize the number of people who need access to sensitive data
4. **Efficient Triage**: Quickly identify areas that need deeper investigation

## Converting to Full Knowledge

### When to Convert

There are specific scenarios when converting to full knowledge is appropriate:

1. **Critical Anomalies**: When a zero-knowledge report identifies a high-severity anomaly
2. **Security Incidents**: During active security incident investigation
3. **Debugging Complex Issues**: When troubleshooting requires full context
4. **Compliance Audits**: When auditors need to verify specific log entries

### The Conversion Process

NeuralLog provides a secure process for converting zero-knowledge reports to full knowledge:

```javascript
// Generate a zero-knowledge report
const zkReport = await neurallog.generateReport({
  timeRange: { start: '2023-06-01', end: '2023-06-30' },
  type: 'anomaly-detection'
});

// Identify specific log entries that need investigation
const logIdsToInvestigate = zkReport.getSignificantLogIds();

// Request decryption (requires appropriate permissions)
const decryptionRequest = await neurallog.requestDecryption({
  logIds: logIdsToInvestigate,
  reason: 'Investigating critical anomaly from ZK report',
  reportId: zkReport.id
});

// If using m-of-n key sharing, gather approvals
const approvalStatus = await neurallog.getDecryptionApprovalStatus(
  decryptionRequest.id
);

// Once approved, decrypt the logs
if (approvalStatus.approved) {
  const decryptedLogs = await neurallog.decryptLogs(
    decryptionRequest.id
  );
  
  // Generate full knowledge report
  const fullReport = await neurallog.generateFullReport(
    zkReport.id,
    decryptedLogs
  );
}
```

### M-of-N Key Sharing for Decryption

For sensitive environments, NeuralLog supports m-of-n key sharing for decryption:

1. **Key Splitting**: The decryption key is split into n shares
2. **Threshold Approval**: At least m shares are required for decryption
3. **Approval Workflow**: Designated approvers provide their shares
4. **Audit Trail**: All approvals and decryptions are logged

```javascript
// Administrator setup of m-of-n sharing
await neurallog.setupKeySharing({
  threshold: 3, // m: number of shares required
  totalShares: 5, // n: total number of shares
  approvers: [
    { email: 'security-lead@example.com', name: 'Security Lead' },
    { email: 'ciso@example.com', name: 'CISO' },
    { email: 'privacy-officer@example.com', name: 'Privacy Officer' },
    { email: 'cto@example.com', name: 'CTO' },
    { email: 'legal-counsel@example.com', name: 'Legal Counsel' }
  ]
});

// Approval process
// Each approver receives a notification and must approve
await neurallog.approveDecryption({
  requestId: decryptionRequest.id,
  approverEmail: 'security-lead@example.com',
  approverKey: '...' // Approver's key share
});
```

### Example Full Knowledge Report

Once converted, a full knowledge report provides complete details:

          "message": "Payment processing failed",
          "data": {
            "user_id": "user-789",
            "error": "Invalid card format",
            "transaction_id": "tx-456",
            "amount": 99.99
          }
        },
        // Additional logs...
      ]
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "id": "rec-001",
      "priority": "high",
      "action": "Update payment processor integration to handle new API format",
      "affected_components": ["payment-service"],
      "estimated_effort": "medium"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security and Compliance Considerations

### Access Control

NeuralLog implements strict access controls for full knowledge conversion:

1. **Role-Based Access**: Only authorized roles can request decryption
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Decryption requests must include a valid reason
3. **Scope Limitation**: Only specific logs can be decrypted, not entire datasets
4. **Time Limitation**: Decrypted data is available for a limited time

### Audit Trail

All conversions from zero-knowledge to full knowledge are comprehensively logged:

```json
{
  "audit_id": "audit-789012",
  "action": "decrypt_logs",
  "user": {
    "id": "user-123",
    "email": "security-lead@example.com",
    "role": "security-lead"
  },
  "request": {
    "id": "decryption-request-456",
    "timestamp": "2023-06-16T09:23:45Z",
    "reason": "Investigating critical anomaly from ZK report",
    "report_id": "zk-report-123456"
  },
  "approvals": [
    {
      "approver": "security-lead@example.com",
      "timestamp": "2023-06-16T09:25:12Z"
    },
    {
      "approver": "ciso@example.com",
      "timestamp": "2023-06-16T09:27:33Z"
    },
    {
      "approver": "privacy-officer@example.com",
      "timestamp": "2023-06-16T09:30:05Z"
    }
  ],
  "logs_decrypted": {
    "count": 27,
    "ids": ["log-12345", "log-12346", "log-12347", "..."]
  },
  "access_expires": "2023-06-17T09:23:45Z"
}
```

### Compliance Benefits

This approach provides significant compliance benefits:

1. **Data Minimization**: Only decrypt what's absolutely necessary
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Clear documentation of why data was decrypted
3. **Access Controls**: Strict controls on who can decrypt data
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete records of all decryption activities
5. **Time Limitation**: Automatic expiration of decrypted data access
