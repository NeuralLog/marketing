# NeuralLog's Zero-Knowledge Architecture

NeuralLog is built on a revolutionary zero-knowledge architecture that provides unprecedented security and privacy for your telemetry and logging data. This document explains how our zero-knowledge approach works and why it matters.

## What is Zero-Knowledge?

In traditional logging systems, your data is encrypted in transit and at rest, but the service provider holds the encryption keys and can access your plaintext data. This creates a significant security risk - if the provider is breached, your sensitive data could be exposed.

NeuralLog's zero-knowledge architecture is fundamentally different:

1. **Client-Side Encryption**: All data is encrypted on your systems before transmission
2. **No Server Keys**: Our servers never possess the encryption keys
3. **Blind Processing**: We process and index your data without ever seeing its contents
4. **Client-Side Decryption**: Data is only decrypted on authorized client devices

This means that even if our entire infrastructure were compromised, attackers would gain access to nothing of value - just encrypted data and meaningless tokens.

## The TypeScript Client SDK: The Cornerstone of Zero-Knowledge

At the heart of NeuralLog's zero-knowledge architecture is our TypeScript Client SDK:

1. **Complete Client-Side Cryptography**: All encryption, decryption, and key management happens exclusively in the client SDK
2. **No Server-Side Secrets**: Passwords and master secrets never leave the client
3. **Deterministic Key Derivation**: All encryption keys are derived client-side from API keys or master secrets
4. **Searchable Encryption**: The SDK generates search tokens that enable searching without revealing content

This client-centric approach means that even if you gave away the "keys to the kingdom" (server infrastructure), an attacker would still be unable to read your logs without the proper API keys or master secrets.

## The Hierarchical Key System (H-Keys)

At the heart of NeuralLog's security is our deterministic hierarchical key system:

### How H-Keys Work

1. **Master Secret**: Everything derives from one master secret (password, seed phrase, or m-of-n shared secret)
2. **Deterministic Derivation**: All keys are mathematically derived using well-defined paths
3. **Zero Server Knowledge**: Server stores only metadata and verification hashes, never secrets

```
master_secret
├── tenant/{tenantId}/encryption
├── tenant/{tenantId}/search
├── tenant/{tenantId}/user/{userId}/api-key
├── tenant/{tenantId}/user/{userId}/auth
├── tenant/{tenantId}/log/{logId}/encryption
└── tenant/{tenantId}/log/{logId}/search
```

### Benefits of H-Keys

- **Simplicity**: One master secret generates the entire key hierarchy
- **No Key Storage**: No need to store or manage individual keys
- **Deterministic Regeneration**: Keys can be regenerated anytime with the master secret
- **Flexible Security Models**: Works with passwords, seed phrases, or m-of-n sharing
- **Efficient Revocation**: Individual keys can be revoked without affecting others

## Zero-Knowledge Authentication

NeuralLog's authentication system never stores actual API keys:

### API Key Verification

1. When a developer generates an API key, only a verification hash is sent to the server
2. The actual API key is shown once and saved by the developer
3. When the API key is used, we verify it against the hash without ever storing the key itself

### M-of-N Key Sharing

For enterprise security, NeuralLog supports Shamir's Secret Sharing:

1. The master secret is split into N shares
2. Any M shares can reconstruct the secret (where M ≤ N)
3. This ensures no single administrator has complete control
4. Perfect for secure key recovery and administrative transitions

## Zero-Knowledge Storage

All data in NeuralLog is stored with end-to-end encryption:

### Log Encryption

1. Logs are encrypted client-side using AES-256-GCM
2. Encryption keys are derived from API keys and never sent to the server
3. Each log entry has its own encryption key derived deterministically
4. The server stores only encrypted data and search tokens

### Searchable Encryption

NeuralLog's searchable encryption enables searching without decryption:

1. Search tokens are generated client-side using HMAC with tenant-specific keys
2. Tokens are sent to the server along with encrypted content
3. The server indexes tokens without knowing what they represent
4. Searches match tokens without ever decrypting log content

## Zero-Knowledge Reports to Full Knowledge

NeuralLog provides a unique capability to generate insights while maintaining privacy:

### Zero-Knowledge Reports

1. Pattern detection on encrypted data using token frequency analysis
2. Anomaly detection by comparing token patterns over time
3. Volume metrics and trends without accessing plaintext data
4. Reports that identify patterns without revealing sensitive details

### Selective Conversion to Full Knowledge

When needed, zero-knowledge reports can be converted to full knowledge:

1. Identify patterns or anomalies in zero-knowledge reports
2. Request decryption of specific logs related to those patterns
3. Use m-of-n key sharing to authorize selective decryption
4. Gain full visibility into specific issues while maintaining overall privacy

## AI Integration with Zero-Knowledge

NeuralLog enables AI-powered analysis without compromising security:

### Machine Comprehension Protocol (MCP)

1. Structured data format optimized for AI consumption
2. Encrypted at rest and in transit
3. Selective disclosure controls for AI systems
4. Contextual enrichment without exposing sensitive data

### Agent Framework Integration

NeuralLog integrates seamlessly with AI agent frameworks:

1. SDK adapters for popular agent frameworks, all built on our TypeScript Client SDK
2. Zero-knowledge authentication for AI agents, with all cryptographic operations happening client-side
3. Granular permission controls for AI access, without compromising the zero-knowledge architecture
4. Audit trails for all AI interactions, while maintaining end-to-end encryption

## Why Zero-Knowledge Matters

NeuralLog's zero-knowledge architecture provides several critical benefits:

1. **Breach Immunity**: Even a complete compromise of our systems reveals no plaintext data
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps meet GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory requirements
3. **Reduced Liability**: We cannot access your sensitive data, even if legally compelled
4. **Trust Minimization**: You don't need to trust us with your sensitive data
5. **Future-Proof Security**: Resistant to advances in cryptographic attacks

## Hosted vs. Self-Hosted: Equal Security

Whether you choose NeuralLog Cloud or self-hosted NeuralLog, you get the same zero-knowledge security guarantees:

1. **Same Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption happens on your systems through our TypeScript Client SDK
2. **Same Zero-Knowledge Protocols**: Identical security architecture in both models, with the client SDK as the cornerstone
3. **Same SDK Implementation**: The same secure client libraries power both options, ensuring consistent security
4. **No Trust Required**: Because the TypeScript Client SDK handles all cryptographic operations, you don't need to trust our infrastructure

The primary differences are in operational aspects (management, scaling, updates) rather than security fundamentals. In both cases, the TypeScript Client SDK ensures that your data remains secure and private.

## Conclusion

NeuralLog's zero-knowledge architecture represents a fundamental shift in logging and telemetry security. By ensuring that sensitive data is never exposed to our systems, we provide unprecedented security and privacy while still enabling powerful search, analysis, and AI integration capabilities.

At the core of this architecture is our TypeScript Client SDK, which handles all cryptographic operations client-side. This cornerstone component ensures that sensitive data and encryption keys never leave your systems, giving you complete control over your data.

This approach eliminates an entire class of security risks and provides a level of security that traditional logging systems simply cannot match. With NeuralLog, you can confidently log sensitive data knowing that even if our entire infrastructure were compromised, your data would remain secure.
