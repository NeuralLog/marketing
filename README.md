# NeuralLog: Zero-Knowledge Telemetry and Logging

## Transform Your Data Without Exposing It

In today's data-driven world, your logs and telemetry contain both your most valuable insights and your most sensitive data. Traditional logging solutions force you to choose between powerful analytics and data privacy.

**NeuralLog eliminates this impossible choice.**

As the world's first zero-knowledge telemetry and logging platform, NeuralLog delivers powerful insights from your existing logs while mathematically guaranteeing that your sensitive data remains privateâ€”even from us.

## The Zero-Knowledge Difference

### How Traditional Logging Works

1. You send plaintext logs to the service
2. The service stores and indexes your plaintext data
3. The service has complete access to all your sensitive information
4. If the service is breached, your data is exposed

### How NeuralLog Works

1. Your logs are encrypted on your systems before transmission
2. Only encrypted data and search tokens reach our servers
3. We analyze patterns and anomalies without ever decrypting your data
4. Even a complete breach of our systems reveals nothing of value

## Powerful Capabilities, Complete Privacy

### ðŸ”’ Zero-Knowledge Security

Built on mathematical guarantees, not promises:

- **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption happens on your systems
- **Zero Server Access**: We never possess your encryption keys
- **Deterministic Key System**: Hierarchical keys derived from master secrets
- **Verifiable Security**: Security properties that can be mathematically proven

### ðŸ§  AI-Powered Analysis

Harness AI without exposing your data:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify complex patterns across encrypted logs
- **Early Warning Signals**: Detect emerging issues before they impact users
- **Predictive Analytics**: Anticipate problems before they occur
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Quickly identify the source of issues

### ï¿½ Searchable Encryption

Search without decryption:

- **Full-Text Search**: Search your encrypted logs as if they were plaintext
- **Advanced Queries**: Field-specific, phrase, and range searches
- **High Performance**: Fast results even with millions of logs
- **Multi-User Access**: Team members search the same encrypted data

## Key Features

### Zero-Knowledge Authentication

NeuralLog's authentication system is built on zero-knowledge principles:

- **API Key Verification**: Verify API keys without storing them
- **Hierarchical Key System**: Deterministic key derivation from master secrets
- **M-of-N Key Sharing**: Secure key recovery requiring multiple administrators
- **Immediate Revocation**: Instantly revoke access without key redistribution

### Searchable Encryption

Search your logs without compromising security:

- **Token-Based Search**: Search encrypted logs without server decryption
- **Advanced Query Support**: Field-specific, phrase, and range searches
- **Tenant-Consistent Keys**: Multiple users can search the same encrypted logs
- **High-Performance Indexing**: Fast search results even with millions of logs

### Zero-Knowledge Reports

Get insights without exposing sensitive data:

- **Pattern Analysis**: Identify patterns across encrypted logs
- **Anomaly Detection**: Spot unusual behavior without decryption
- **Volume Metrics**: Track usage patterns while maintaining privacy
- **Selective Disclosure**: Convert zero-knowledge reports to full knowledge when needed

### AI Integration with MCP

Connect your AI systems securely:

- **Machine Comprehension Protocol**: Structured data for AI consumption
- **Agent Framework Support**: Ready for LangChain, AutoGPT, and other frameworks
- **Contextual Enrichment**: Provide AI systems with necessary context
- **Privacy Controls**: Fine-grained control over what AI systems can access

## Deployment Options

### NeuralLog Cloud

The fastest way to get started:

- **Fully Managed**: We handle infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance
- **Global Availability**: Deploy in regions worldwide
- **Enterprise SLAs**: 99.99% uptime guarantee for enterprise plans
- **Dedicated Tenants**: Complete isolation for enterprise customers

### Self-Hosted NeuralLog

Complete control over your deployment:

- **Docker Containers**: Easy deployment with Docker and Kubernetes
- **On-Premises**: Keep everything within your network
- **Air-Gapped**: Support for completely disconnected environments
- **Hybrid Options**: Mix cloud and self-hosted components

## Benefits of NeuralLog Cloud vs. Self-Hosted

| Feature | NeuralLog Cloud | Self-Hosted |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Setup Time | Minutes | Hours to days |
| Maintenance | Fully managed | Self-managed |
| Scaling | Automatic | Manual or K8s |
| Updates | Automatic | Self-managed |
| Geographic Distribution | 20+ regions | DIY |
| Cost Model | Subscription | Infrastructure + licenses |
| Security | Zero-knowledge + our infrastructure | Zero-knowledge + your infrastructure |
| Compliance | SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR | Depends on your implementation |
| SLA | Up to 99.99% | DIY |

Both options provide the same zero-knowledge security guarantees, as all encryption happens client-side.

## Zero Friction Integration

### Works With Your Existing Stack

- **Drop-in Adapters**: For all major logging frameworks
- **Cross-Language Support**: TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, Ruby, PHP, and more
- **Framework Integration**: Express, Spring, Flask, ASP.NET, and others
- **Minimal Code Changes**: Often just a single line of code

### Immediate Value

- **Instant Insights**: Gain valuable insights from day one
- **No Configuration**: Automatic pattern detection without setup
